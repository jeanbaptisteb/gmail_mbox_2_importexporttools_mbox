gmail_mbox_2_importexporttools_mbox
===================================

A script to convert gmail mbox format to "importexporttools" mbox format. Useful for importing emails from gmail accounts with Thunderbird.

More detailed explanations:

Google allows exporting all emails from gmails, thanks to Google Takeout. The archive is composed of mbox files and subdirectories (if you use labels in your gmail account).



The problem is that only one tool allows the import of mbox files : importexportTools (an extension for Thunderbird).

But this tool can't import the mbox archives generated by Google, because it has different requirements (for instance, folders need to have a '.sbd' extension). 

Therefore, the purpose of this python script is to convert the archive generated by Google to a format recognized by ImportExportTools.
